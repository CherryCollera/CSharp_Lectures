Web-Based Applications
-Runs within an Internet browser 
-Collection of one or more related files or components stored on a server
-MessageBox dialog boxes are not used with Web applications 
-Every postback trip to the server creates new object 
Causes Web pages to be stateless

Static Pages
-Client-side application
Provide no interaction with the user

Dynamic Pages
-Involve processing in addition to rendering the formatting HTML tags 
One programming model is to use traditional or classic Active Server Pages (ASP) 
_______________________________________________________________
ASP.NET
Newer model for Web development 
Does not require writing code in a separate scripting language 
Includes a number of classes as part of the .NET Framework 

Two options for developing ASP.NET applications
-Use the new ASP.NET Development Server
-Second option: use Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 


To identify an ASP from an ASP.NET Web application, look at file extensions
-ASP Web page ends with an .asp file extension 
-ASP.NET Web page ends with an .aspx file extension 




Code-Behind File
Where the programming logic resides  
Stores event-handler methods

-No Main( ) method 
-Page_Load( ) event handler 
-Can debug and execute Web application from within the IDE 
-No hidden .designer.cs file as with Windows apps


-Default.aspx created and automatically opened in Source view 
-App_Data folder is automatically created


File ending in .aspx holds the HTML tags
First two lines in the .aspx markup file are called page directives
Page directives are delimited with <%@ and %>

runat=server - run as server control

Visual Studio prefixes the control name with <asp:control and ends the tag with /asp:control>
Also runat= "server " appended
<asp:control attributes runat="server " /asp:control>
Stored in HTML document – file ending with .aspx extension
